   isar - Integration System for Automated Root filesystem generation

   Isar is a set of scripts for building software packages and repeatable
   generation of Debian-based root filesystems with customizations.

                                     Build

    1. Install and configure sudo (see TODO):

 # apt-get install sudo
 # visudo

       In the editor, allow the current user to run sudo without a password,
       e.g.:

 <user>  ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL

       Replace <user> with your user name. Use the tab character between and
       parameters.

    2. Initialize the build directory, e.g.:

 $ cd isar
 $ . isar-init-build-env ../build

    3. Build the root filesystem image:

 $ bitbake core-image-base

   Created image is in

 tmp/deploy/images/core-image-base-zynq.sdimg

                                      Test

   Test the image with qemu:

 start_armhf_vm
